Comparison analysis to Citi Bike NYC

- After careful comparison analysis between NYC and Des Moines census information, we have come to several conclusion. 

The questions we are trying to answer are:

What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

## There is a large difference between population and land sq. mile area between 2 cities

- New York City's current population is 8,175,133 while Des Moines current population is 203,433. This is barely a 2% of New York City's population.

- New York City's land square miles area is 302.6 mi2 while Des Moines land square miles area is 82.6 mi2. This is 27% of NYC. 

- Despite this large differences, the population gender and average age of both cities are very similar. NYC average population age is 35.8 years and Des Moines is 34 years. 59% of NYC population age is between 18 and 64 years old and Des Moines population age between 18 and 64 years old is 57%. The female percentages in NYC and Des Moines are 52% and 51% respectively and the male population is 48% and 49%. There is a lot of similarity between both cities in regards to gender diversification and population ages.

This analysis provides a lot of valuable information, especially on the last point. After completing the NYC Citi Bike analysis, we see a lot of trends in relation to age and gender. Even though we are comparing two very different cities in size and population, we can expect similar behaviors. 

## Tourism in Des Moines and NYC. 

- NYC is one of the most visited cities by tourists in the world, yet because of the large number of people visiting, the bike service can be saturated. There are many people that would prefer a different mode of transportation to go around in NYC. Beside the large amount of traffic in the streets, can become really dangerous to ride bikes in this city, yet the Citi Bike service is successful. In regards to Des Moines, the city is a lot smaller, this means less traffic and less people on the streets. A more quiet and slow pace city helps give people the experience of exploring the city on a bike ride. 

 - According to "We Are Iowa" news, summer of 2019 had a record of tourist attendance to the 2019 Iowa State Fair. An estimate of 1,170,375 tourist attended the State Fair in Des Moines that lasted 11 days. This is a yearly event and keeps growing in attendance year to year. This is a great opportunity for the Citi Bike service in Des Moines. A graphic of the tourism growth over the last 6 years is presented.

## Existing bicycle service in Des Moines. 

-Currently there is an existing service in the city, called Des Moines BCycle. Currently it has 20 stations and 120 bikes. The Citi Bike service could partner up with BCycle and help in exponentially improve the business. With BCyle small infrastructure and Citi Bike renowned name and popularity the city could really benefit from the service.

### Recommendations for deeper investigation.

a- NYC is a city with a large population, and medium size area. There is a really big amount of visitors per year hence traffic is really heavy in this city. A more practical way of transportation is a great option for tourist. Public transportation is preferred in NYC for the heavy traffic. A Bike sharing service makes a lot of sense because of this situation. A deeper investigation into traffic behavior in Des Moines could help to understand in which areas the service could be more attractive to the visitors and residents. 

b- As seen in the investigation, there is a small existing bike sharing service already installed in Des Moines. A deeper investigation into how service is currently doing in the city could help to come up with better marketing and infrastructure plans.

c- Negotiation strategies have to be planned in order to try and fine the impact of an existing bike sharing service or an alliance with Des Moines BCycle.

d- A larger investigation into prefer mode of transportation in Des Moines would help the investigation a great deal.

e- A larger investigation into NYC station locations to better understand what attracts the people more and try to apply same techniques in Des Moines.
